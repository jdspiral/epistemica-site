We built Epistemica because weâ€™re living through an epistemic crisis.

Truth is no longer shared ground. People interpret the same information in radically different ways â€” and those divergences are accelerating. Policy teams, communicators, and institutions are flying blind, trying to reach audiences that live in separate interpretive worlds.

**Epistemica is a belief simulation platform** that models how different communities interpret the same information, and how those interpretations evolve over time. We use a combination of structured reasoning, epistemic trait modeling, and vector embeddings to make belief formation visible and measurable.<br><br>

## Our Mission

We donâ€™t just want to predict reactions.  
We want to **rebuild visibility into belief** â€” to show not just what people think, but _why_ they think it.  
Our goal is to offer a transparent foundation for constructive disagreement, narrative analysis, and institutional alignment.<br><br>

## What Weâ€™re Building

- A simulation engine that interprets claims through distinct community lenses  
- A reasoning trace for each interpretation, showing step-by-step logic  
- Embedding vectors that track **belief drift**, convergence, and conflict  
- Tools for **strategists, communicators, and researchers** to understand how beliefs form, spread, and polarize<br><br>

## Who We Are

Epistemica was founded by **Joshua Hathcock**, a software engineer, writer, and public philosopher. His work sits at the intersection of epistemology, culture, and technology.

> "Iâ€™ve always felt a gap between how events are presented and whatâ€™s actually true.  
> Philosophy helped me see the assumptions beneath the surface â€” but it was only when I started building with AI that I realized I could make those assumptions visible, modelable, and open to scrutiny."

Josh also writes [**The Performance Age**](https://theperformanceage.com/), a public philosophy project exploring how algorithmic logic and media incentives are reshaping how we think, argue, and perform.<br><br>

## Whatâ€™s Next

Weâ€™re currently in alpha. The simulation demo is live, and weâ€™re gathering feedback from researchers, analysts, and strategists.

If you care about:

- Bridging divides instead of amplifying them  
- Making reasoning visible and falsifiable  
- Rebuilding public trust in how knowledge is formed  

Weâ€™d love to talk.<br><br>
