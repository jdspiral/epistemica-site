# ðŸ§  Epistemica

**Simulate belief systems. See not just what agents believe â€” but *why*, and how their beliefs evolve over time.**

Epistemica lets you explore how different cognitive agents interpret the same headline using layered reasoning:
- Epistemic frameworks (e.g., Rationalism, Folk Logic)
- Interpretive schemas (e.g., Institutional Trust, Anti-Elite)
- Traits like logic, emotion, skepticism
- Trust levels for sources like Substack or academic journals
- Drift over time based on shocks or fatigue
