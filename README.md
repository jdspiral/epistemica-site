# 🧠 Epistemica

**Simulate belief systems. See not just what agents believe — but *why*, and how it changes.**

Epistemica models how different cognitive agents interpret the same event using layered reasoning:
- Epistemic frameworks (e.g., Rationalism, Folk Logic)
- Interpretive schemas (e.g., Institutional trust, Anti-elite filters)
- Meta-traits (e.g., logic, emotion, skepticism)
- Source trust (e.g., substack vs journal)
- Drift over time from repeated exposure or shocks

## 🧠 Why Epistemica?

> “Why do two smart people interpret the same headline completely differently?”

Epistemica is an attempt to answer that — not by generating text, but by modeling **reasoning architectures** and tracking **epistemic drift**.

Whether you're working in AI safety, political forecasting, or cognitive modeling, understanding **belief formation under pressure** is critical.

## 🧬 System Overview

```
Ontology → Framework → Schema → Traits → Agent → Belief → Drift
```

📉 Includes visualizations:
- PCA projection of belief space
- Drift trajectories over time
- Justification blocks (by trait, schema, framework)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Streamlit UI + OpenAI API
- FastAPI backend (WIP)
- SQLite cache (for beliefs + drift)
- PCA + UMAP projection (via sklearn + plotly)
